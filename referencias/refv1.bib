  abstract = {Validation is a necessary step for model acceptance. No single combination of validation tests will be applicable across the diverse range of models and their uses. Choice of technique is important, as some contain problems and inconsistencies. Subjective assessment can be useful as a guide. Within visual techniques, observed vs. predicted plots are shown to have superior diagnostic capabilities compared to the more widely-used time-series plots. Mean absolute error is demonstrated as a more robust deviance measure than mean absolute percent error, and within the statistical tests a nominated sub-set of some simpler statistics should reveal most of the required information. The modelling efficiency is proposed as the best overall measure of agreement between observed and simulated values.}

  abstract = {Nowadays bootstrap techniques are used for data analysis in many other fields like engineering, physics, meteorology, medicine, biology, and chemistry. In this paper, the robustness of Wu (1986) and Liu (1988)'s Wild Bootstrap techniques is examined.  The empirical evidences indicate that these techniques yield efficient estimates in the presence of heteroscedasticity problem. However, in the presence of outliers, these estimates are no longer efficient. To remedy this problem, we propose a Robust Wild Bootstrap for stabilizing the variance of the regression estimates where heteroscedasticity and outliers occur at the same time. The proposed method is based on the weighted residuals which incorporate the MM estimator, robust location and scale, and the bootstrap sampling scheme of Wu (1986) and Liu (1988). The results of this study show that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones in every respect.}

Some asymptotic results are given.}
